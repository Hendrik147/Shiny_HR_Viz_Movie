# Shiny_HR_Viz_Movie

For my own learning process I have been trying to replicate the Shiny gallery example "051-movie-explorer" available from the following link:
https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples/tree/master/051-movie-explorer

I think the "movie explorer" example is very typical for HR visualisations. Scatter plots are heavily used in HR and I would benefit from mastering those in Shiny.
The two csv files are completely made up HR data, although similar to what I would be able to extract from my own SAP HCM environment. The data relate to absences, excess time worked by staff and flexi leave taken.

I also found a video from Jonathan McPherson where he explains the debugging techniques:
